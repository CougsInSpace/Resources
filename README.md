# Getting Involved with Cougs in Space #
Cougs in Space is currently developing its first nanosatellite, **CougSat-1**, at Washington State University.

## Step One: Nanosatellites ##
* Read [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)
* Read [NASA's CubeSat 101](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/Subsystems/General/NASACubeSat101.pdf)
* Read the [CubeSat Specifications](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/CubeSatSpecifications/CubeSatDesignSpecificationRev13.pdf)

## Step Two: Find a Team ##
Our [website](https://cis.vcea.wsu.edu/our-teams/) describes each sub team's roles. Find one that is interesting that you want to join and [let us know](https://cis.vcea.wsu.edu/new-member-application-form/).

## Step Three: Join Github ##
Don't know what Github is? [Learn here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Step Four: Check out our SOPs ##
These are the standard operating procedures within Cougs in Space:
* [Acronyms](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/StandardOperatingProcedures/Acronyms.1.2.0.pdf)
* [Coding conventions](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/StandardOperatingProcedures/Code.1.0.1.pdf)
* [Github](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/StandardOperatingProcedures/GitHub.1.0.1.pdf)
* [Project Management](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/StandardOperatingProcedures/ProjectManagement.1.0.2.pdf)
* [Units](https://github.com/CougsInSpace/Resources/blob/master/StandardOperatingProcedures/Units.1.1.0.pdf)

## Step Five: Start Working ##
